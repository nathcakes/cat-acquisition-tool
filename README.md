## What Is This? 
The Cat Acquisition Tool (C.A.T) is a node script that uses playwright to scrape my local animal shelter's adoption page and notify me of any new cats uploaded to the site via [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh).

## Why Did I Make It?
Unfortunately we lost our family cat just before Christmas 2023 and we were searching for a new friend to join the family. The local animal shelter works on a first come first serve basis and they have no system to notify you of new uploads unfortunately so I decided to create this tool to help us in our search.

## Run Command
I'm currently running this on my Raspberry Pi 4. In case I forget the command to keep it running after ssh is `nohup npm run script &`.
